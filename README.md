# React Daily Projects (TypeScript)

This repository contains a **14-day hands-on React learning program**
designed using **TypeScript** and **mini-projects**.

The goal is not just to learn React syntax, but to understand:
- Why React concepts exist
- How to think in components
- How to build scalable UI step by step

Each folder represents **one day of learning** with:
- Clear concept explanations
- A focused mini-project
- Practical assignments

## How to Use This Repo
- Start with `day-01-components-jsx`
- Read the README.md inside each day
- Run the project

This material can be used for:
- Self-learning
- Team training
